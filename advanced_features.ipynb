      "\n",
      "AutoGen is an open-source programming framework for building AI agents and facilitating cooperation among multiple agents to solve tasks. AutoGen aims to streamline the development and research of agentic AI, much like PyTorch does for Deep Learning. It offers features such as agents capable of interacting with each other, facilitates the use of various large language models (LLMs) and tool use support, autonomous and human-in-the-loop workflows, and multi-agent conversation patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Open Source Statement**: The project welcomes contributions from developers and organizations worldwide. Our goal is to foster a collaborative and inclusive community where diverse perspectives and expertise can drive innovation and enhance the project's capabilities. Whether you are an individual contributor or represent an organization, we invite you to join us in shaping the future of this project. Together, we can build something truly remarkable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The project is currently maintained by a [dynamic group of volunteers](https://butternut-swordtail-8a5.notion.site/410675be605442d3ada9a42eb4dfef30?v=fa5d0a79fd3d4c0f9c112951b2831cbb&pvs=4) from several different organizations.

       "ChatResult(chat_id=None, chat_history=[{'content': 'You\\'re a retrieve augmented chatbot. You answer user\\'s questions based on your own knowledge and the\\ncontext provided by the user.\\nIf you can\\'t answer the question with or without the current context, you should reply exactly `UPDATE CONTEXT`.\\nYou must give as short an answer as possible.\\n\\nUser\\'s question is: What is autogen?\\n\\nContext is: Autogen enables the next-gen LLM applications with a generic [multi-agent conversation](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat) framework. It offers customizable and conversable agents that integrate LLMs, tools, and humans.\\nBy automating chat among multiple capable agents, one can easily make them collectively perform tasks autonomously or with human feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code.\\n\\nFeatures of this use case include:\\n\\n- **Multi-agent conversations**: AutoGen agents can communicate with each other to solve tasks. This allows for more complex and sophisticated applications than would be possible with a single LLM.\\n- **Customization**: AutoGen agents can be customized to meet the specific needs of an application. This includes the ability to choose the LLMs to use, the types of human input to allow, and the tools to employ.\\n- **Human participation**: AutoGen seamlessly allows human participation. This means that humans can provide input and feedback to the agents as needed.\\n\\nFor [example](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/test/twoagent.py),\\n\\n```python\\nfrom autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, config_list_from_json\\n# Load LLM inference endpoints from an env variable or a file\\n# See https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/FAQ#set-your-api-endpoints\\n# and OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample\\nconfig_list = config_list_from_json(env_or_file=\"OAI_CONFIG_LIST\")\\n# You can also set config_list directly as a list, for example, config_list = [{\\'model\\': \\'gpt-4\\', \\'api_key\\': \\'<your OpenAI API key here>\\'},]\\nassistant = AssistantAgent(\"assistant\", llm_config={\"config_list\": config_list})\\nuser_proxy = UserProxyAgent(\"user_proxy\", code_execution_config={\"work_dir\": \"coding\", \"use_docker\": False}) # IMPORTANT: set to True to run code in docker, recommended\\nuser_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message=\"Plot a chart of NVDA and TESLA stock price change YTD.\")\\n# This initiates an automated chat between the two agents to solve the task\\n```\\n\\nThis example can be run with\\n\\n```python\\npython test/twoagent.py\\n```\\n\\nAfter the repo is cloned.\\nThe figure below shows an example conversation flow with AutoGen.\\n![Agent Chat Example](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/website/static/img/chat_example.png)\\n\\nAlternatively, the [sample code](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/samples/simple_chat.py) here allows a user to chat with an AutoGen agent in ChatGPT style.\\nPlease find more [code examples](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Examples#automated-multi-agent-chat) for this feature.\\n\\n<p align=\"right\" style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\">\\n  <a href=\"#readme-top\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\">\\n    â Back to Top â\\n  </a>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Enhanced LLM Inferences\\n\\nAutogen also helps maximize the utility out of the expensive LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. It offers [enhanced LLM inference](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/enhanced_inference#api-unification) with powerful functionalities like caching, error handling, multi-config inference and templating.\\n\\n<!-- For example, you can optimize generations by LLM with your own tuning data, success metrics, and budgets.\\n\\n```python\\n# perform tuning for openai<1\\nconfig, analysis = autogen.Completion.tune(\\n    data=tune_data,\\n    metric=\"success\",\\n    mode=\"max\",\\n    eval_func=eval_func,\\n    inference_budget=0.05,\\n    optimization_budget=3,\\n    num_samples=-1,\\n)\\n# perform inference for a test instance\\nresponse = autogen.Completion.create(context=test_instance, **config)\\n```\\n\\nPlease find more [code examples](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Examples#tune-gpt-models) for this feature. -->\\n\\n<p align=\"right\" style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\">\\n  <a href=\"#readme-top\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\">\\n    â Back to Top â\\n  </a>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nYou can find detailed documentation about AutoGen [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/).\\n\\nIn addition, you can find:\\n\\n- [Research](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Research), [blogposts](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog) around AutoGen, and [Transparency FAQs](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/TRANSPARENCY_FAQS.md)\\n\\n- [Discord](https://aka.ms/autogen-dc)\\n\\n- [Contributing guide](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Contribute)\\n\\n- [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/microsoft/projects/989/views/3)\\n\\n<p align=\"right\" style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\">\\n  <a href=\"#readme-top\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\">\\n    â Back to Top â\\n  </a>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Related Papers\\n\\n[AutoGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155)\\n\\n```\\n@inproceedings{wu2023autogen,\\n      title={AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation Framework},\\n      author={Qingyun Wu and Gagan Bansal and Jieyu Zhang and Yiran Wu and Beibin Li and Erkang Zhu and Li Jiang and Xiaoyun Zhang and Shaokun Zhang and Jiale Liu and Ahmed Hassan Awadallah and Ryen W White and Doug Burger and Chi Wang},\\n      year={2023},\\n      eprint={2308.08155},\\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\\n      primaryClass={cs.AI}\\n}\\n```\\n\\n[EcoOptiGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04673)\\n\\n```\\n@inproceedings{wang2023EcoOptiGen,\\n    title={Cost-Effective Hyperparameter Optimization for Large Language Model Generation Inference},\\n    author={Chi Wang and Susan Xueqing Liu and Ahmed H.

AutoGen aims to streamline the development and research of agentic AI, much like PyTorch does for Deep Learning. It offers features such as agents capable of interacting with each other, facilitates the use of various large language models (LLMs) and tool use support, autonomous and human-in-the-loop workflows, and multi-agent conversation patterns.\\n\\n**Open Source Statement**: The project welcomes contributions from developers and organizations worldwide. Our goal is to foster a collaborative and inclusive community where diverse perspectives and expertise can drive innovation and enhance the project\\'s capabilities. Whether you are an individual contributor or represent an organization, we invite you to join us in shaping the future of this project. Together, we can build something truly remarkable.\\n\\nThe project is currently maintained by a [dynamic group of volunteers](https://butternut-swordtail-8a5.notion.site/410675be605442d3ada9a42eb4dfef30?v=fa5d0a79fd3d4c0f9c112951b2831cbb&pvs=4) from several different organizations.

It simplifies the orchestration, automation, and optimization of a complex LLM workflow. It maximizes the performance of LLM models and overcomes their weaknesses.\\n- It supports [diverse conversation patterns](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat#supporting-diverse-conversation-patterns) for complex workflows. With customizable and conversable agents, developers can use AutoGen to build a wide range of conversation patterns concerning conversation autonomy,\\n  the number of agents, and agent conversation topology.\\n- It provides a collection of working systems with different complexities. These systems span a [wide range of applications](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat#diverse-applications-implemented-with-autogen) from various domains and complexities. This demonstrates how AutoGen can easily support diverse conversation patterns.\\n- AutoGen provides [enhanced LLM inference](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/enhanced_inference#api-unification). It offers utilities like API unification and caching, and advanced usage patterns, such as error handling, multi-config inference, context programming, etc.\\n\\nAutoGen is created out of collaborative [research](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Research) from Microsoft, Penn State University, and the University of Washington.\\n\\n<p align=\"right\" style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\">\\n  <a href=\"#readme-top\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\">\\n    â Back to Top â\\n  </a>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Roadmaps\\n\\nTo see what we are working on and what we plan to work on, please check our\\n[Roadmap Issues](https://aka.ms/autogen-roadmap).\\n\\n<p align=\"right\" style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\">\\n  <a href=\"#readme-top\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\">\\n    â Back to Top â\\n  </a>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Quickstart\\nThe easiest way to start playing is\\n1. Click below to use the GitHub Codespace\\n\\n    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/microsoft/autogen?quickstart=1)\\n\\n 2. Copy OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample to ./notebook folder, name to OAI_CONFIG_LIST, and set the correct configuration.\\n 3. Start playing with the notebooks!\\n\\n*NOTE*: OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample lists GPT-4 as the default model, as this represents our current recommendation, and is known to work well with AutoGen. If you use a model other than GPT-4, you may need to revise various system prompts (especially if using weaker models like GPT-3.5-turbo). Moreover, if you use models other than those hosted by OpenAI or Azure, you may incur additional risks related to alignment and safety. Proceed with caution if updating this default.\\n\\n<p align=\"right\" style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\">\\n  <a href=\"#readme-top\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\">\\n    â Back to Top â\\n  </a>\\n</p>\\n\\n## [Installation](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Installation)\\n### Option 1.
